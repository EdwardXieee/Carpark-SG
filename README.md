# Carpark-SG

In Singapore, finding parking spaces and comparing costs remain persistent challenges for drivers on a daily basis. The availability of parking spaces and the efficiency of search have become key determinants of commuting experience and traffic congestion, and are regarded as an "urgent problem" in relevant literature. Our project proposes Car Park Finder+, which is a cloud-based SaaS product. It helps users find parking lots with available spaces nearby, estimate parking fees in advance, predict the number of available parking spaces, and provide alternative options that are walkable, have lower prices, or have less foot traffic.

In order to ensure that the solution is based on verifiable and publicly accessible information, we will mainly utilize Singapore's open data (such as the availability and metadata of parking spaces from HDB/LTA/URA), which can be accessed through data.gov.sg or other authoritative data websites.
